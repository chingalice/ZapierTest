# Zapier Marketing Data Analyst
Take Home Assignment


## Part One - Data Exploration

Tools I tried: 

* DataGrip - Rationale for using this is to get familiar with what Zapier team uses. It was easy to download, connect to Redshift, and do quick summaries on the dataset (see zapierpart1.sql).
* Matillion ETL - same rationale. However, I didn't get to setup the trial account.
* Looker - no Looker account and it would take time to go through demo and set things up.  
* Tableau Public - No connection to Redshift.
* Mode Analytics Studio/Excel - used it to access data and run visualizations. 


## Part Two - ETL

* Tools used: Mode Analytics Studio and DataGrip
* Process: 

1) I took 3 sample user IDs to map out what it would look like in Excel. 
2) Created a column on "Date" listing all dates from Jan 1 to Jun 1, 2017.
3) Queried on these 3 user IDs with their activities, export, and did a vlookup in Excel to map it to the date column 
4) Evaluated whether the user is active or churn (boolean variable).


* See zapierpart2.sql for more details. 



## Part Three - Data Analysis and Visualizations

* Tool used: Mode Analytics Studio

* See zapierpart3.md for more details and screenshots.
