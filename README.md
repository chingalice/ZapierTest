# Zapier Marketing Data Analyst
Take Home Assignment


## Part One - Data Exploration

I tried the following tools:

* DataGrip - Rationale for using this is to get familiar with what Zapier team uses. It was easy to download, connect to Redshift, and do quick summaries on the dataset. 
* Matillion ETL - same rationale. However, I didn't get to setup the trial account but saw that it's somewhat similar to Alteryx.
* Looker - I am a Looker fan with no Looker account. They don't have trial account and it would take time to go through demo and set things up. 
* Tableau Public - I wanted to use it to do visualizations but they don't have a way to connect to Redshift unfortunately.
* Mode Analytics Studio - after no success with Looker, this was the next one I thought of using as I have a mode account. And Muness also recommends trying this one out.
